## Blended Shake

### Base
* 1/2 c Ricotta cheese
    * low fat works, for less calories

    * Ice size varies, you may need to experiment here
    * Add less, blend, then check
* 1/2 T Truvia (or any sweetener)
    * Skip if using sweetened milk
* 1/4-3/4 c water
    * Still figuring this one out
