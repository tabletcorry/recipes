## Blended Shake

### Base
* 1/2 c Ricotta cheese
    * Skim milk works well here
* 1/4 c Almond milk
    * Low sugar works well here, sweetener below compensates
* 1-2 cubes ice
    * Ice size varies, you may need to experiment here
    * Add less, blend, then check
* 1/2 tsp Truvia (or any sweetener)
    * Skip if using sweetened milk
* 1/4 c water
    * Controls how thick the shake is. At 1/4 it is very dense.
    * You can always add more, so start with this amount
* Pinch of salt
* 1/2 Graham cracker
    
### "Apple Pie" blend
* 1/2 c Apple Sauce
* 1/2 tsp Cinnamon
* 1/4-1/2 tsp caramel

### Banana blend
* 1 banana, chopped

### "Smores" blend (experimental)
* 1/4 cup marshmallow creme
* 1/2 tsp unsweetened cocoa

### Notes
* The amounts above produce about 4 fl oz of "flavor" and 8 fl oz of "base"
      * 12 fl oz mix is about 2 servings. It is quite filling.
      * A serving is 200-400 calories, depending on additions. The base is very low calorie.
      * A serving also has >7g protein, which is part of why it is filling.
* More sugar/sweetener is the most likely need. Depends on Apple sauce sweetness, or what primary sweetener you use.

### Instructions

If making a single batch, just blend it all together. You may want to add the ice in last to prevent melting.

If making ahead of time, hold the graham cracker and ice from the base. Prepare base and blend seperately, then mix and serve for each serving. See notes for ratios to mix.
Alternately, just make a bunch of the base. The various flavor blends are very quick to make, and people can experiment with the base on their own.
