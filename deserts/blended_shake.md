## Blended Shake

### Base
* 1/2 c Ricotta cheese
    * low fat works, for less calories
* 1/4 c Almond milk
    * Low sugar works, but you must add artifical sweetener below
* 1-2 cubes ice
    * Ice size varies, you may need to experiment here
    * Add less, blend, then check
* 1/2 tsp Truvia (or any sweetener)
    * Skip if using sweetened milk
* 1/4-3/4 c water
    * Still figuring this one out
    * Controls how thick the shake is. At 1/4 it is very dense.
* Pinch of salt
    
### "Apple Pie" blend
* 1/2 c Apple Sauce
* 1/2 tsp Cinnamon
* 1/2 Graham cracker
* 1/4-1/2 tsp caramel

### Notes
* More sugar/sweetener is the most likely need. Depends on Apple sauce sweetness
* Alternate blends (not "Apple Pie") may still need the graham cracker as a thickener

Blend all ingredients, except the ice.

Crush the ice, then blend it in.

Taste and adjust, or just serve.
