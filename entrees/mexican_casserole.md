## Mexican Casserole

* Approx 2 lbs cooked chicken, chopped/pulled
    * Sous vide chicken works well
    * Store bought rotisserie chicken also works
    * Poached chicken works well
* 8 oz cheddar cheese, shredded
* 8 oz jack cheese, shredded
* 1 can cream of chicken
* 2 c chicken broth
* 1 bag corn tortillas

Cook chicken if required.

Set oven to 350 degrees.

Layer torn tortillas, chicken, and cheese (in that order) in a 9x13 baking dish. Two to three layers is expected.

Mix cream of chicken and chicken broth in medium bowl. Pour over layered ingredients evenly.

Place in oven, cook for 45-60 minutes. Done when bubbling all over and cheese is starting to brown.

Let rest after cooking, to allow it to set (and not burn your mouth).

Serve with tortilla chips. No silverware required :)
